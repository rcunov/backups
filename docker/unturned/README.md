# Notes

Work in progress. Weird issue where ServerHelper.sh doesn't work as expected if not attached to the terminal, can't run it from CMD or anything. Besides, I have to run it twice (once to build the server, then go back and configure it, then run it for real) so I don't know how I'm supposed to script that.

Current workflow is run container, open a shell, run "ServerHelper.sh +InternetServer/MyServer", type "shutdown", copy the Commands.dat config file, then re-run ServerHelper.
